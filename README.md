# Astral Sorcery Anti Anti Fake Player

## What?
This mod makes it so fake players (such as the user from cyclic or player simulator from integrated dynamics) can use Astral Sorcery machines (such as the grindstone)

## How?
It's very simple, the developer of Astral Sorcery specifically made a check to block fake players from interacting with his machines, so this mod just removes that check.

## Why?
I just don't like it when mod developers try to change how YOU play the game. If you want to use automation, you do, if you don't, you don't. It shouldn't be up to the mod.
